# Declutter WP

A plugin for WordPress that removes unnecessary clutter to improve security and performance.

## Description

WordPress clutters your code with multiple links to diverse pages (home, parent, previous, next, random etc.) and feeds, as well as support for JSON REST API, OEmbed, XML-RPC, Windows Live Writer, Really Simple Discovery and Emojis. Often these features are not needed or wanted. The plugin removes all the clutter by default, but offers options to enable the features, if needed. The plugin is simple by design, because it's meant to be comfortable and fast.

## Installation

1. [Download the plugin](https://github.com/operat/declutter-wp/archive/master.zip)
2. Upload `declutter-wp` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin in WordPress
